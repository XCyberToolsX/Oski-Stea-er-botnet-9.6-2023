Oski Stealer 9.6 is an extremely advanced stealer showcasing many desired features such as credit card and wallet stealing. Firstly, this stealer is completely web-based, accessible from any device and can be hosted offshore for anonymity.

Secondly, the payload will self destruct after loading, making it hard to trace the malware. Given the strong stealing features alongside being silent makes this extremely severe. In other words, alongside an exploit this stealer can be spread completely undetected. Allowing you to grow logs of data on a new level for any of your needs. However, with this stealer being completely native, working on all systems, it is arguably the best. In conclusion we highly suggest using Oski Stealer alongside any of our exploits to expand any of your data logging needs!
